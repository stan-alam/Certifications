## ITCA certification

```ascii
The Information Technology Certified Associate (ITCA) certification from ISACA is an entry-level assessment of your general 
familiarity with the five major components of IT: computing, networks and infrastructure, cybersecurity, software development, 
and data science fundamentals. To earn the ITCA, you'll have to take five separate exams related to those five domains – 
each of which costs $- [ ]. The content of each exam is designed to prove a general, low-level familiarity.
What are the fundamentals of software development?

The fundamentals of software development aren't purely technical in nature. Familiarity with programming languages and an 
understanding of machine logic are important parts of software development. But software development is a process, and the 
preliminary and follow-up steps of development are just as important as depth of familiarity with languages. For instance, 
gathering requirements, designing the architecture, testing, debugging, and version control are all just as important as writing code.
Which ISACA certification is easiest?

The easiest ISACA certification to earn is the Information Technology Certified Associate (ITCA). Designed to be an early-career 
overview of the essential subjects related to working in IT, preparing for the ITCA is easy but time-intensive. You'll want to be 
familiar with the essentials of computing, networking, cybersecurity, software development, and data science, as well as the specific 
ways in which those subjects will be tested on the ITCA tests.
Who should take this software development fundamentals course?

If you plan on earning the ITCA certification from ISACA, this course is designed to help you prepare for its software development test. 
But even if you don't plan on earning the ITCA, this course is a valuable resource for shedding light on what software development is 
and how to talk about it. If you manage personnel or projects that involve software development, this course is an essential professional tool.
